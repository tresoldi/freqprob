**General Frequency Estimation:**
1. **Simple Good-Turing** - Excellent when frequency patterns are reliable
2. **ELE** - Strong theoretical foundation
3. **Bayesian (α=0.5)** - Good balance
4. **Laplace** - Reliable and robust
5. **Lidstone (tuned γ)** - Good with parameter optimization

### Scaling Behavior

How performance changes with dataset size:

#### Time Complexity:
- **MLE, Laplace, ELE**: O(n) where n = vocabulary size
- **Simple Good-Turing**: O(n + k log k) where k = unique frequency counts
- **Kneser-Ney**: O(m) where m = number of n-grams
- **Bayesian**: O(n)

#### Space Complexity:
- **Basic methods**: O(n)
- **SGT**: O(n + k)
- **Kneser-Ney**: O(m + contexts)

## Performance Optimization Tips

### General Optimization

2. **Vectorize operations**: Process multiple queries simultaneously
3. **Cache frequently accessed probabilities**: Significant speedup for repeated queries
4. **Choose right smoothing strength**: Balance accuracy and robustness

### Specific Method Optimizations

**Simple Good-Turing:**
- Works best with reliable frequency-of-frequencies
- May fail on irregular distributions
- Consider fallback to ELE or Laplace

**Kneser-Ney:**
- Requires sufficient n-gram data
- Use discount parameter tuning (typically 0.75)
- Consider Modified KN for better performance

**Bayesian Smoothing:**
- Tune α parameter using validation data
- α=0.5 often works well (Jeffreys prior)
- α=1.0 equivalent to Laplace smoothing

### Memory Optimization
1. **Use quantization**: Trade slight accuracy for major memory savings
2. **Implement streaming**: For large-scale or real-time applications
3. **Apply compression**: When memory is more critical than speed
4. **Monitor usage**: Profile to identify bottlenecks

## Conclusion

FreqProb offers a range of smoothing methods suitable for different scenarios. The choice depends on your specific requirements for accuracy, speed, memory usage, and reliability.

**Default recommendation**: Start with **ELE smoothing** for general use or **Kneser-Ney** for language modeling, then optimize based on profiling results.

**Performance tip**: Always measure on your specific data and use case - theoretical complexity doesn't always predict real-world performance.
